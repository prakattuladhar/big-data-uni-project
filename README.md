The goal of this project to use the big data computing tools we cover in this class to analyze and
extract useful information from a dataset of your choice. When evaluating your project, I will
consider:
- The usefulness of the dataset.
- The selected data analysis tasks.
- Presentation, summarization, and visualization of your results.
- Report writing.
